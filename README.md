# Project Overview

This project analyzes Unicorn's sales data to uncover insights for business growth. We examined trends in customer behavior, product performance, and regional profitability using Google Sheets, SQL, and Tableau.

## Approach to Data

### Data Cleaning
Extensive data cleaning was conducted to ensure accuracy, including adjustments to the Profit Rate based on defined formulas and assumptions.

### Assumptions
We assumed that Profit, Sales, Quantity, Discounts, and other variables were clearly defined and consistently applied throughout the dataset.

## Problem Statement


### High Customer Count but Low Profitability
Cities such as Houston, Philadelphia, Dallas, and Chicago have over 77 customers but are operating at a loss. In contrast, New York demonstrates the highest profitability. There exists a significant gap in profit per customer, with New York achieving an average profit of $62.02 compared to Philadelphia's loss of $-13.83.

## Key Insights

- **Seasonal Sales with Low Profit Growth**: December experiences a sales spike of $35,568; however, profit does not grow proportionally, likely due to high discounts (exceeding 29%) and lower-margin products.
  
- **Impact of Discounts on Profitability**: Discounts above 30% significantly affect profitability, particularly in the Furniture and Office Supplies categories. For example, even a modest 0.3% discount on Tables and Binders results in negative profits.
  
- **Delivery Impact on Profit**: Longer delivery times in states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Florida negatively influence profitability, especially for Tables. Shipping delays beyond 5 days lead to increased costs and reduced customer satisfaction.
  
- **Unprofitable Products**: Products sold by nearly all manufacturers in selected subcategories are unprofitable, which may be attributed to pricing, production costs, or product quality issues.

## Recommendations

- **Focus on Profitability in Cities**: Unicorn should reevaluate its strategy in loss-making cities with high customer counts, such as Houston, Philadelphia, Dallas, and Chicago. Conduct market segmentation to tailor strategies and enhance profitability.
  
- **Optimize Product and Delivery Strategy**: Improve delivery times in targeted regions and consider expanding product offerings in the underperforming Furniture category to capture more market share.
  
- **Enhance Seasonal Strategy**: Maximize sales in Quarter 4 through targeted promotions while investigating why increased revenue does not translate into higher profits.
  
- **Refine Discount Policy**: Limit discounts to 30% or less for sensitive categories and explore tiered discounts for lower-demand products.
  
- **Establish a Quality-Based Supplier Optimization Program**: Focus on improving profitability through better supplier quality management.

## Conclusion

Unicorn should prioritize regional expansion while optimizing product offerings, discount strategies, and delivery efficiency. By addressing issues such as shipping times, excessive discounts, and operational inefficiencies, both profitability and customer satisfaction can be significantly enhanced.
